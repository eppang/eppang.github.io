## About
My coworkers and I were tasked with creating an infographic to display the different statistics of the seminars our department hosts with journalists from all over the world. The infographic displays the different seminars our program offers, the number of participants in each program, and the number of different countries the journalists came from. The infographic also displays some fiscal information on the general funding of the program. Our job was to present the information in an eye-pleasing manner, as the infographic would be shown around the East-West Center (a non-profit organization which focuses on strengthening the ties between the U.S. and Asia).

## Role and Responsibilities
For this project, I worked in a team of 3 people, which included my coworkers Priscilla Zheng and Michelle Ngo. The workload was split evenly three ways, and our roles were all very similar; we would take turns working on the infographic and would switch off whenever one of us had to leave for class. We all agreed on a color scheme and equally looked up free vectors, modified them in Photoshop, and organized the layout. If we wanted to add something, we would bounce ideas off of each other before agreeing to add another portion to the infographic.

## What I Learned
This project taught me the essentials of collaboration and teamwork; you can't be afraid to receive criticism or to voice your own ideas when it comes to creating something new. Everyone has something to contribute, and it all works out when everyone puts forth an effort. Not only did I have to collaborate with my coworkers, I had to collaborate with the different staff within our department, who would also give feedback on the infographic. It gave me experience working with different kinds of people and allowed me to practice giving and receiving ideas from other people, and then build off of those ideas.
