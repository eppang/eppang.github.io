In my senior year of high school, I still didn't know what I wanted to study once I graduated. I didn't know what college I wanted to go to or what major I should start with. I was conflicted because I liked art and drawing, yet I knew that realistically, these interests most likely wouldn't be enough to support me as an adult. My dad in particular was the type to stress getting a good job in the STEM field to get a good, secure job and be successful.  At the last minute, I chose to go into Civil Engineering since it was a popular major that almost guaranteed good pay once graduating college. I wasn't particularly skilled in math or physics, but I chose to do it anyway, reassured by the large amount of my friends who also had chosen to pursue engineering. My parents were satisfied and proudly announced to everyone that I was going to be an engineer. Adults nodded approvingly when I told them what my intended major was. I ended up going to UH since my dad said that "there was no point in going to a mainland school and spending all that money; UH has a decent engineering program already". 

Perhaps because my heart wasn't in it, I was immediately unhappy with my first semester of college. I already hated my major from the start, and I dreaded the extra physics and calculus classes that were headed my way. When choosing the classes for my second semester, I decided to take ICS 111 since it was one of the required classes for Civil Engineering. After several weeks into the second semester, I found myself actually enjoying ICS. I had no prior knowledge of Java or computer programming at this point, but it was interesting and I enjoyed solving the problems that were given to us. I looked up the major requirements online, and it seemed to realistically mold better to what I thought I was capable of. At the end of my second semester, I switched into Computer Science.

The first TA I had met in ICS listened to my story of how I didn't know what kind of career I wanted to pursue, and provided me with a list of job opportunities that were available to me with a Computer Science degree. Since I had always leaned toward art and design, I became interested in the aesthetic side of computer science, such as website design and human-computer interaction. I was close friends with others who had taken ICS 314, and was interested in their work with design in the class. It looked like hard work in terms of the hours they needed to put into their projects, but I wondered whether it would be something I would be interested in too.

Finally, this leads me to where I am today. Now that I find myself in the class, I'm hoping to get to be more familiar with Javascript and HTML, and hopefully become comfortable enough to create a project that I could be proud of. I know that this class encourages working with others; I have never worked in a team with classmates on an ICS project before, and I am looking forward to collaborating with others. I've been worried about job interviews in the future, since I've heard that interviewers would throw programming problems at you and put you on the spot, so I was glad to hear on the first day of this class that we would be getting comfortable with this routine to prepare us for the future. I hope that I can gain confidence in myself and my own abilities after taking this class as well.
