## Beginnings
As a programmer, I'm relatively new to the area. ICS 111 was the first time I experienced any sort of coding; Java became the first language I learned. With Java, I learned the importance of different variable types, classes, and methods. Sometimes I would forget the return type of a method and try to return a different type of variable instead. When I was first starting out, I always forgot to initialize new arrays. One particular thing I would always get confused on was whether a method should be static or not. Java is an organized language that is meticulously designed to make life easier for the user, but can get confusing if you don't know what you're doing.

After learning Java, I learned C and C++ in ICS 212. Compared to Java, C was like a nightmare to me. Having to keep track of pointers was my own version of hell. I didn't like how long it took to try to compile my code, or even having to write a Makefile to compile the code faster. It seemed like a lot of extra work to me. I'm very much aware that C is like a second language to some people, but for me as a relatively new computer science major, it was... scarring. Perhaps that's an exaggeration, but it's to try to make you get the point. 

## First Impressions
Imagine after going through C and C++, my reaction when I first learned Javascript in Freecodecamp! A language with no variable types?! You don't have to declare the type of the function?! It doesn't even matter whether or not you use "" or ''! I enjoyed the freedom from these previous responsibilities that this language gave. It made it seem almost too easy. If there's no variable types, you can't get different variable mismatches, and there's no pointers or core dumps. Javascript seems like a very simple programming language, but due to its simplicity, can have the potential to become complicated since it seems to leave a lot up to the programmer.

Who knows, maybe in two weeks I'll be regretting having said all of this; after all, I've only witnessed the beginnings of Javascript. It's a bit forboding when the Google results for searching "why Javascript is easy" are "Who said javascript was easy?" and "Why is Javascript So Hard To Learn?" Some of you who may be reading this may be chuckling in your seats, thinking "wait until she encounters <insert common Javascript problem here>!" It's true, I can be pretty ignorant at times. I might regret saying this, but I think I've handled enough up to this point to be confident that I can handle the majority of what Javascript throws at me.
