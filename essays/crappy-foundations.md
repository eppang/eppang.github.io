## Early Teachings
Some of my core design concepts are founded upon a single acronym I learned long ago as a junior in high school. I took an IT internship that Kamehameha Schools was offering, and the first two weeks were spent with a team that specialized in design and infographics. Before sending us off to make infographics of our own, we were taught the principles of C.R.A.P., which stood for **C**ontrast, **R**epetition, **A**lignment, and **P**roximity. These principles were very basic guidelines of how to make any design look organized and complete.
### Contrast
Color is a huge part of design, and it can be very easy to screw up if you aren't aware of what colors would go well together. Having good contrast ensures that your text and graphics stand out and are clearly visible. A good reference that I learned from my internship was to look for colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel. 

Contrast doesn't just lie in color, though. Other types of contrast that can be used to benefit your design can be size, whether it be the size of text or size of different shapes. In this essay, for example, the headline 'Early Teachings' is bigger than 'Contrast', to emphasize that the subject 'Contrast' falls under 'Early Teachings'. Contrasting sizes can send small meanings to the viewer and make the design of whatever you make more comprehensible.
