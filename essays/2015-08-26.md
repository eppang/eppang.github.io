In my senior year of high school, I still didn't know what I wanted to study once I graduated. I didn't know what college I wanted to go to or what major I should start with. I was conflicted because I liked art and drawing, yet I knew that realistically, these interests most likely wouldn't be enough to support me as an adult. My dad in particular was the type to stress getting a good job in the STEM field to get a good, secure job and be successful.  At the last minute, I chose to go into Civil Engineering since it was a popular major that almost guaranteed good pay once graduating college. I wasn't particularly skilled in math or physics, but I chose to do it anyway, reassured by the large amount of my friends who also had chosen to pursue engineering. My parents were satisfied and proudly announced to everyone that I was going to be an engineer. Adults nodded approvingly when I told them what my intended major was. I ended up going to UH since my dad said that "there was no point in going to a mainland school and spending all that money; UH has a decent engineering program already". 

Perhaps because my heart wasn't in it, I was immediately unhappy with my first semester of college. I already hated my major from the start, and I dreaded the extra physics and calculus classes that were headed my way. When choosing the classes for my second semester, I decided to take ICS 111 since it was one of the required classes for Civil Engineering. After several weeks into the second semester, I found myself actually enjoying ICS. I had no prior knowledge of Java or computer programming at this point, but it was interesting and I enjoyed solving the problems that were given to us. I looked up the major requirements online, and it seemed to realistically mold better to what I thought I was capable of. At the end of my second semester, I switched into Computer Science.
